# Film



## Getting started

First clone a copy of the repo.
```
Using SSH: 
git clone git@gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no:tdt4140-2024/produktomraade-4/gruppe-67/film.git

Using HTTPS: 
git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/tdt4140-2024/produktomraade-4/gruppe-67/film.git
```
Then make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS installed. If you are unsure try running 
```
node -v
```
It should return something like this:
```
10.2.4
```
If you don't have NodeJS installed, you can install it by following the instructions on page
**For mac:**
```
brew install node
```
**For Windows:**  
First install Chocolatey by following the instructions on this link: https://chocolatey.org/install (Note: You don't necessarily need chocolatey to install NodeJS, but it's a good package manager to have for Windows. And it makes it easier to install NodeJS.)

Then run the following command in the terminal:
```
choco install nodejs.install
```
If you get any errors make sure you are running the with admin privileges and verify your chocolatey installation by running the following command:
```
choco -v
```

Verify your Node install by running the following command in the terminal:
```
npm -v
```
It should return something like this:
```
film git:(main) âœ— npm -v           
10.2.4
```
Then navigate to the root of the project and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies. (This might take a bit of time)
```
cd film
npm install
```
If you get an error like this
```
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall open
npm ERR! path /home/nils/Documents/Skole/V24/PU/Film/film/package.json
npm ERR! errno -2
npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/nils/Documents/Skole/V24/PU/Film/film/package.json'
npm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.
npm ERR! enoent 

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in: /home/nils/.npm/_logs/2024-02-05T20_31_47_454Z-debug-0.log
```
Then you should run the following command:
```
cd film
```
And after that try running the following command again:
```
npm install
```
After that you should be able to run the project by running the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the project running!


## Before making a pull request:
Before making a pull request, make sure to run the following command to make sure that the code is formatted correctly.
```
npx prettier . --write
```
Then run the Linter
```
npm run lint
```
If the Linter returns any errors, you should fix them before making a pull request.
The linter should return something like this when all errors are resolved:
```

> film@0.1.0 lint
> next lint

âœ” No ESLint warnings or errors
```
If both of those are good then submit a pull request and ask someone from the group and get it reviewed and merged!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥



The rest of this readme is boilerplate from GitLab, and is not relevant to our project.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
